# 🔄 How to Apply Risk Level Fix

Your frontend code has been **fixed and rebuilt**, but you need to reload it.

## ✅ The Fix is Correct

**Score 68/100 should show as MEDIUM RISK (yellow), NOT HIGH RISK**

According to the fixed logic:
- Score >= 80 → LOW RISK (green) 🟢
- Score >= 60 → MEDIUM RISK (yellow) 🟡 ← **68 should be here!**
- Score >= 30 → HIGH RISK (orange) 🟠
- Score < 30 → CRITICAL RISK (red) 🔴

## 🚀 Steps to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)

In your Replit console:

1. **Stop the current dev server** (Ctrl+C or kill the process)

2. **Start fresh:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **In your browser:**
   - Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
   - Or open in **Incognito/Private window**

### Option 2: Use Production Build

```bash
npm run start
```

This will serve the freshly built production version (already compiled with the fixes).

## 🧪 How to Verify the Fix Works

1. **Go to your assessment results page** with score 68

2. **You should see:**
   - Badge: **"MEDIUM RISK"** in **yellow** 🟡
   - Message: **"Good compliance with improvement opportunities"**
   - Gauge color: **Yellow**
   - NOT red or orange!

3. **Test other scores:**
   - Try score 25 → Should show **CRITICAL** (red)
   - Try score 45 → Should show **HIGH** (orange)
   - Try score 68 → Should show **MEDIUM** (yellow)
   - Try score 85 → Should show **LOW** (green)

## 🐛 If Still Showing Wrong

If you still see "HIGH RISK" for score 68:

1. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images/files
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data → Cache

2. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any errors

3. **Verify the correct file is loaded:**
   - F12 → Network tab
   - Reload page
   - Look for `index-BiSflY00.js` (the new build)

4. **Last resort - Hard restart:**
   ```bash
   # Kill everything
   pkill -f "vite|node"

   # Start fresh
   npm run dev
   ```
