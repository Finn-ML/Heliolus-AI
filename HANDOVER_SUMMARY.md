## 🔧 Bugs Fixed During This Session

### 1. React Refresh Module Error ✅
**Symptom:** Chrome/Safari showing `The requested module '/@react-refresh' does not provide an export named 'injectIntoGlobalHook'`

**Fix:** Cleared Vite cache and optimized configuration

### 2. Blocked Host Error ✅
**Symptom:** `This host (...replit.dev) is not allowed`

**Fix:** Added Replit domains to allowed hosts:
```typescript
// frontend/vite.config.ts
allowedHosts: ['.replit.dev', '.repl.co']
```

### 3. Infinite Page Reload ✅
**Symptom:** Page constantly reloading

**Fix:** Simplified Vite HMR configuration

### 4. React Query Undefined Data ✅
**Symptom:** `Query data cannot be undefined`

**Fix:** Changed API function to return data directly instead of accessing `.data` property:
```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/api.ts
getAssessmentResults: async (assessmentId: string) => {
  return await apiRequest<AssessmentResults>(`/assessments/${assessmentId}/results`);
}
```

### 5. Schema Validation Error ✅
**Symptom:** `"estimatedCost" is required!`

**Fix:** Added missing fields to gap selection:
```typescript
// backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts
gaps: {
  select: {
    // ... existing fields
    priorityScore: true,
    estimatedCost: true,
    estimatedEffort: true,
    suggestedVendors: true,
  }
}
```
