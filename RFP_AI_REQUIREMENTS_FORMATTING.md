# RFP AI Requirements Formatting Enhancement

## Problem Statement

The RFP auto-fill was generating technical requirements that looked like raw AI analysis output rather than professional, client-facing RFP content. The requirements included internal assessment language like:

```
The evidence indicates that while there are systems in place for both fraud detection and AML monitoring, there is a lack of comprehensive integration between these systems...
```

This language is:
- ❌ Too verbose and analytical
- ❌ Contains internal assessment phrases ("The evidence indicates...")
- ❌ Focuses on assessment findings, not solution requirements
- ❌ Not appropriate for vendor-facing RFP documents
- ❌ Lacks professional RFP formatting

## Solution Implemented

Added **AI-powered transformation** of raw gap descriptions into professional, solution-focused RFP technical requirements using OpenAI.

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
Assessment Gaps (Raw)
         ↓
   [AI Analysis Service]
  formatGapsForRFP()
         ↓
Professional RFP Requirements
         ↓
   [RFP Form Auto-Fill]
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User selects assessment** in RFP form
2. **Auto-fill triggered** → Frontend calls backend API
3. **Backend fetches gaps** from assessment results
4. **AI formatting** → OpenAI transforms gaps into requirements
5. **Professional output** → Returned to frontend
6. **Form populated** → Requirements field filled with formatted text

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend AI Service Method

**File**: `backend/src/services/ai-analysis.service.ts`

**New Method**: `formatGapsForRFP(gaps, templateName)`

```typescript
async formatGapsForRFP(gaps: any[], templateName: string): Promise<string> {
  await this.ensureOpenAIInitialized();

  if (!this.useOpenAI || !this.openai) {
    return this.formatGapsBasic(gaps); // Fallback
  }

  const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `You are a professional RFP writer specializing in compliance technology solutions.

Guidelines:
- Use professional, client-facing language
- Focus on required capabilities, not assessment findings
- Be concise but specific (2-3 sentences max per requirement)
- Use active voice and solution-oriented wording
- Remove internal analysis language like "The evidence indicates..."
- Format as numbered requirements with severity indicators
- Focus on WHAT is needed, not WHY it was identified`
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Transform these ${templateName} assessment gaps into professional RFP technical requirements:
${JSON.stringify(gapsData, null, 2)}`
      }
    ],
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 2000,
  });

  return formattedRequirements;
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective formatting
- ✅ Specific RFP-focused system prompt
- ✅ Transforms up to 10 gaps
- ✅ Includes severity, description, impact, current state
- ✅ Fallback to basic formatting if AI unavailable

### 2. Fallback Formatting (No AI)

**Method**: `formatGapsBasic(gaps)`

```typescript
private formatGapsBasic(gaps: any[]): string {
  return gaps.slice(0, 10).map((gap, index) => {
    const severity = gap.severity || 'MEDIUM';
    const description = gap.description || gap.title;

    // Extract key points (first 2 sentences)
    const sentences = description.split(/[.!?]+/).filter(s => s.trim().length > 0);
    const brief = sentences.slice(0, 2).join('. ') + '.';

    return `${index + 1}. [${severity}] ${this.extractRequirementTitle(brief)}
   ${this.transformToRequirement(brief)}`;
  }).join('\n\n');
}
```

**Helper Methods:**
- `extractRequirementTitle()` - Removes analysis phrases, creates concise title
- `transformToRequirement()` - Converts gap language to requirement language

**Text Transformations:**
- "The evidence indicates that" → "Solution must address:"
- "there is no/limited/insufficient" → "Must implement"
- "does not currently have" → "requires"
- "is not performed regularly" → "must be performed regularly"
- "lacks" → "requires"

### 3. Backend API Endpoint

**File**: `backend/src/routes/assessment.routes.ts`

**New Endpoint**: `GET /v1/assessments/:id/rfp-requirements`

```typescript
server.get('/:id/rfp-requirements', {
  preHandler: [authenticationMiddleware],
  schema: {
    description: 'Get professionally formatted RFP technical requirements from assessment gaps',
    tags: ['Assessments'],
    params: { id: { type: 'string' } },
    response: {
      200: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          success: { type: 'boolean' },
          data: {
            formattedRequirements: { type: 'string' },
            assessmentName: { type: 'string' },
            gapCount: { type: 'number' },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}, async (request, reply) => {
  // Get assessment results
  const results = await assessmentService.getResults(assessmentId, user.id);

  // Get template name
  const assessment = await prisma.assessment.findUnique({
    where: { id: assessmentId },
    include: { template: { select: { name: true } } },
  });

  const templateName = assessment?.template?.name || 'Compliance';

  // Format gaps using AI
  const { aiAnalysisService } = await import('../services/ai-analysis.service.js');
  const formattedRequirements = await aiAnalysisService.formatGapsForRFP(
    results.gaps || [],
    templateName
  );

  reply.send({
    success: true,
    data: {
      formattedRequirements,
      assessmentName: templateName,
      gapCount: results.gaps?.length || 0,
    },
  });
});
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Authenticated endpoint (requires login)
- ✅ Returns formatted requirements + metadata
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Works with any assessment type

### 4. Frontend Integration

**File**: `frontend/src/components/rfp/RFPFormModal.tsx`

**Updated**: `handleAutoFill()` method

```typescript
// Get professionally formatted requirements from backend AI service
if (results.gaps && results.gaps.length > 0) {
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const rfpRequirementsResponse = await fetch(
      `/v1/assessments/${selectedAssessment.id}/rfp-requirements`,
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        },
      }
    );

    if (rfpRequirementsResponse.ok) {
      const rfpData = await rfpRequirementsResponse.json();
      const formattedRequirements = rfpData.data?.formattedRequirements;

      if (formattedRequirements) {
        setValue('requirements', `Based on our ${templateName} assessment, we require solutions that address the following compliance gaps:\n\n${formattedRequirements}`);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to basic formatting
    setValue('requirements', `Based on our assessment, we identified ${results.gaps.length} compliance gaps that require vendor solutions.`);
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Calls backend API for formatted requirements
- ✅ Adds professional introduction text
- ✅ Graceful fallback if API fails
- ✅ Loading state handled by existing auto-fill logic

## Before & After Examples

### Before (Raw Gap Output)

```
1. [HIGH] The provided documents contain references to compliance frameworks and procedures that suggest an awareness of EU regulations, including the EU AI Act. However, there is no explicit mention of the categorization of AI systems under the EU AI Act, nor detailed compliance requirements specific to the Act. The documents focus more on anti-money laundering and fraud prevention rather than a comprehensive analysis of AI system categorization. Therefore, while there is some evidence of regulatory compliance efforts, it does not directly address the specific question regarding the categorization of AI systems under the EU AI Act.
   Impact: Not specified
   Current State: Non-compliant

2. [HIGH] The evidence indicates that while there are systems in place for both fraud detection and AML monitoring, there is a lack of comprehensive integration between these systems. Document 1 mentions that fraud alerts are shared with AML via a weekly file drop, but it also states that there is currently no unified view between fraud and AML systems. This suggests that while some data sharing occurs, it is not sufficient for full integration, which is necessary for optimizing detection and reducing duplication of efforts.
   Impact: Not specified
   Current State: Non-compliant
```

### After (Professional RFP Requirements)

```
1. [HIGH] EU AI Act Compliance Framework
   Solution must provide comprehensive AI system categorization aligned with EU AI Act requirements, including risk-based classification methodology and detailed compliance documentation for each AI system category.

2. [HIGH] Integrated Fraud and AML Monitoring Platform
   Required: Unified detection platform that consolidates fraud and AML monitoring into a single system with real-time data sharing, eliminating file-based transfers and providing complete visibility across both functions.

3. [HIGH] Internal Audit Management System
   Must implement automated annual audit scheduling, finding tracking, and remediation workflow with configurable audit calendars and status monitoring for all open findings.

4. [HIGH] AI Bias Testing and Fairness Framework
   Solution should include ongoing bias monitoring capabilities with automated drift detection, disparate impact analysis, and continuous fairness metrics evaluation across all AI models.

5. [HIGH] AI Vendor Due Diligence Platform
   Required: Comprehensive vendor risk assessment framework with AI-specific governance controls, continuous performance monitoring, and regulatory compliance tracking for all AI vendor relationships.

6. [CRITICAL] Multi-Jurisdiction Compliance Tracking
   Must provide jurisdiction-specific compliance management for all operating regions, including automated regulatory requirement mapping and compliance status monitoring across international markets.
