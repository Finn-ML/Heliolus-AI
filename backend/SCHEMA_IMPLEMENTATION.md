## Database Schema Highlights

### Relationships
- **One-to-One**: User ‚Üî Organization, User ‚Üî Subscription, Assessment ‚Üî Report
- **One-to-Many**: Organization ‚Üí Documents, Assessment ‚Üí Gaps/Risks, Vendor ‚Üí Solutions
- **Many-to-Many**: Vendor ‚Üî Categories, Solution ‚Üî CompanySizes, Gap ‚Üî VendorMatches

### Indexes for Performance
- Primary lookups: email, organizationId, userId
- Search optimization: companyName, categories, status
- Temporal queries: createdAt, completedAt, expiresAt
- Business logic: matchScore, riskLevel, priority

### Data Validation
- Email format and business domain validation
- Geographic restrictions and allowed countries
- File size and type restrictions
- Credit balance and usage validation
- State transition controls

## Files Created

### Schema & Configuration
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete Prisma schema with all models and relationships
- `/prisma/migrations/` - Database migration files
- `/package.json` - Updated with Prisma seed configuration

### Seed Data
- `/prisma/seed.ts` - Comprehensive seed script with realistic test data

### Type Definitions
- `/src/generated/prisma/` - Generated Prisma client and types
- `/src/types/database.ts` - Custom types for frontend consumption

### Validation & Testing
- `/scripts/validate-schema.ts` - Schema validation and testing script

## Next Steps

1. **API Implementation**: Build REST/GraphQL APIs using the generated types
2. **Authentication Service**: Implement JWT-based authentication with the User model
3. **File Upload Service**: Integrate with AWS S3 for document management
4. **Payment Integration**: Connect Stripe for subscription billing
5. **AI Services**: Implement assessment scoring and vendor matching algorithms
6. **Frontend Integration**: Use the exported types for type-safe frontend development

The schema is now production-ready and provides a solid foundation for the complete Heliolus Platform implementation.
