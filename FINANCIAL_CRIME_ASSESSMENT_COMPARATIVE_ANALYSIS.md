### Frontend Considerations

1. **New Section Types**
   - Technology/Infrastructure sections need different UI
   - AI-specific questions may need explainer tooltips
   - Maturity indicators should show visual progression

2. **Scoring Dashboard**
   - Add spider/radar chart for domain coverage
   - Show AI readiness separately from traditional compliance
   - Include maturity level badge/indicator

3. **Guided Experience**
   - AI questions should have more contextual help
   - Consider conditional questions (if AI used, then ask...)
   - Add "Not Applicable" option for AI questions for non-AI organizations

4. **Competitive Pressure** - Leading vendors will move here within 18 months
5. **Revenue Potential** - Significant pricing power and market expansion

### Implementation Priority
Follow the 3-phase roadmap (12 months):
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Eliminate critical gaps - ‚ö†Ô∏è **START IMMEDIATELY**
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Achieve feature parity with leading vendors
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Become market leader with advanced scoring/benchmarking

### Success Metrics
- Increase questions from 24 ‚Üí 100+ ‚úÖ
