# RFP Auto-Fill Enhancement - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement

The RFP form's auto-fill button was greyed out and non-functional because:
1. It relied on vague "Strategic Roadmap" data that didn't exist
2. Vendors were shown in random order, not by relevance
3. No clear connection between assessments â†’ gaps â†’ RFP â†’ vendors
4. Poor UX - users didn't know what data would be used

## Solution Implemented

Completely redesigned the auto-fill flow to be **assessment-driven** with intelligent vendor matching.

---

## New User Flow

### 1. Click "Auto-Fill from Assessment" Button
- Button is now always enabled (not greyed out)
- Clear label explains data source

### 2. Select Assessment Dialog Opens
- Shows list of completed/in-progress assessments
- Displays for each:
  - Template name (e.g., "Financial Crime Compliance Assessment")
  - Date completed
  - Status badge
  - Number of gaps identified
  - Critical gaps count (if any)
- Click to select â†’ auto-fills immediately

### 3. Form Auto-Populated with Assessment Data

**Title:**
```
"RFP for [Template Name] Solutions"
Example: "RFP for Financial Crime Compliance Solutions"
```

**Objectives:**
```
We are seeking solutions to address compliance requirements identified in our Financial Crime Compliance assessment.

Assessment Summary:
- Overall Risk Score: 7.2/10
- Total Gaps Identified: 12
- Critical Gaps: 3
- Assessment Date: 10/28/2025

Our objective is to implement solutions that address these compliance gaps and improve our overall compliance posture.
```

**Requirements:**
```
Based on our assessment, we require solutions that address the following compliance gaps:

1. [CRITICAL] Insufficient transaction monitoring controls
   Impact: High risk of undetected suspicious activity
   Current State: Non-compliant

2. [HIGH] Inadequate customer due diligence procedures
   Impact: Regulatory exposure and fines
   Current State: Non-compliant

[... up to 10 gaps listed]
```

**Timeline:** (Auto-suggested based on critical gaps)
- 5+ critical gaps â†’ "< 3 months"
- 1-5 critical gaps â†’ "3-6 months"
- 0 critical gaps â†’ "6-12 months"

**Budget:** (Auto-suggested based on gap count/severity)
- 15+ gaps or 5+ critical â†’ "â‚¬100K - â‚¬500K"
- 8-15 gaps â†’ "â‚¬50K - â‚¬100K"
- < 8 gaps â†’ "< â‚¬50K"

### 4. Vendor List Enhanced with Match Scores

**If assessment selected:**
- Vendors fetched from `/assessments/{id}/vendor-matches-v2`
- Sorted by match score (descending)
- Each vendor shows color-coded match badge:
  - ðŸŸ¢ 80%+ match = Green badge
  - ðŸ”µ 60-79% match = Cyan badge
  - ðŸŸ¡ 40-59% match = Yellow badge
  - âšª <40% match = Gray badge
- Top 3 vendors automatically pre-selected
- Header shows "Sorted by match score" indicator

**Without assessment:**
- Shows all approved vendors
- No match scores
- Alphabetical order
- No pre-selection

### 5. Selected Assessment Display

Once assessment is selected, shows banner:
```
âœ“ Using: Financial Crime Compliance Assessment (12 gaps)
   [Re-fill Button] [X Remove]
```

- **Re-fill**: Refresh data from same assessment
- **X**: Clear selection, return to vendor list

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified
`frontend/src/components/rfp/RFPFormModal.tsx`

### Key Changes

#### 1. Replaced Strategic Roadmap with Assessment Data

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: roadmapData, isLoading: roadmapLoading } = useStrategicRoadmap(organizationId);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data: assessments, isLoading: assessmentsLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: queryKeys.assessments,
  queryFn: assessmentApi.getAssessments,
  enabled: open,
});

const completedAssessments = assessments?.filter(
  (a: any) => a.status === 'COMPLETED' || a.status === 'IN_PROGRESS'
) || [];
```

#### 2. Enhanced Vendor Fetching with Match Scores

```typescript
const fetchVendors = async () => {
  if (selectedAssessment?.id) {
    // Fetch vendor matches with scores
    const matchesResponse = await fetch(
      `/v1/assessments/${selectedAssessment.id}/vendor-matches-v2?threshold=0&limit=100`
    );

    const matches = matchesData.data?.matches || [];

    const vendorsWithScores = matches.map((match: any) => ({
      id: match.vendor.id,
      companyName: match.vendor.companyName,
      matchScore: match.totalScore,
      matchQuality: match.matchQuality,
    }));

    // Sort by score descending
    vendorsWithScores.sort((a, b) => (b.matchScore || 0) - (a.matchScore || 0));

    // Pre-select top 3
    if (vendorsWithScores.length > 0) {
      const topVendors = vendorsWithScores.slice(0, 3).map(v => v.id);
      setValue('vendorIds', topVendors);
    }
  }
};
```

#### 3. Assessment-Driven Auto-Fill Logic

```typescript
const handleAutoFill = async () => {
  // Fetch assessment results
  const results = await assessmentApi.getAssessmentResults(selectedAssessment.id);

  // Generate title
  setValue('title', `RFP for ${templateName} Solutions`);

  // Generate objectives with assessment summary
  const objectives = `
We are seeking solutions to address compliance requirements identified in our ${templateName} assessment.

Assessment Summary:
- Overall Risk Score: ${results.riskScore?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A'}/10
- Total Gaps Identified: ${results.gaps?.length || 0}
- Critical Gaps: ${criticalCount}
- Assessment Date: ${date}
  `.trim();

  // Format gaps into requirements
  const requirements = results.gaps
    .slice(0, 10)
    .map((gap, index) => `${index + 1}. [${gap.severity}] ${gap.description}
   Impact: ${gap.impact}
   Current State: ${gap.currentState}`)
    .join('\n\n');

  // Intelligent timeline/budget suggestions
  if (criticalCount > 5) {
    setValue('timeline', '< 3 months');
    setValue('budget', 'â‚¬100K - â‚¬500K');
  }
};
```

#### 4. Assessment Selector Dialog

```typescript
<Dialog open={showAssessmentSelector}>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogTitle>Select Assessment</DialogTitle>
    <div className="space-y-3">
      {completedAssessments.map((assessment) => (
        <div onClick={() => selectAssessment(assessment)}>
          <h4>{assessment.template?.name}</h4>
          <Badge>{assessment.status}</Badge>
          <p>{assessment.gaps?.length} gaps identified</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

#### 5. Enhanced Vendor Display

```typescript
<div className="vendor-item">
  <Checkbox checked={selected} />
  <div>
    <p>{vendor.companyName}</p>
    {vendor.matchScore && (
      <Badge className={getMatchColor(vendor.matchScore)}>
        {vendor.matchScore.toFixed(0)}% match
      </Badge>
    )}
    <p className="categories">{vendor.categories.join(', ')}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
