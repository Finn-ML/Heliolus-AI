## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A Compliance Officer at a mid-sized financial institution needs to assess their organization's compliance posture to identify technology gaps and find suitable vendor solutions. They sign up, complete their business profile with company documents, run a financial crime compliance assessment, receive a detailed gap analysis report, and connect with matching vendors from the marketplace.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Authentication & Onboarding

1. **Given** a new user with business email, **When** they complete signup with organization details, **Then** system sends verification email and blocks access until verified
2. **Given** a user attempting signup with Gmail/Hotmail, **When** they submit the form, **Then** system rejects registration with appropriate message
3. **Given** a user from restricted location (Iran/Russia), **When** they attempt registration, **Then** system blocks signup

#### Business Profile & Assessment

4. **Given** a verified user with company website, **When** they submit website URL and documents, **Then** AI parses content and pre-populates profile fields with gap highlights
5. **Given** a user with completed profile, **When** they select Financial Crime Compliance template, **Then** system runs AI assessment and generates risk categorization
6. **Given** assessment completion, **When** user views results, **Then** system displays gap analysis with Critical/Medium/Low risk classifications

#### Marketplace & Vendor Matching

7. **Given** completed gap analysis, **When** user requests vendor matches, **Then** system recommends relevant solutions from marketplace
8. **Given** marketplace browsing, **When** user selects up to 4 vendors, **Then** system enables side-by-side comparison
9. **Given** paid user status, **When** viewing vendor details, **Then** system enables contact forms and RFP submission

#### Free vs Paid Access

10. **Given** free user with completed assessment, **When** viewing detailed report, **Then** system shows overview only with blurred details
11. **Given** paid user with Premium subscription, **When** accessing reports, **Then** system allows full view and PDF download
12. **Given** free user attempting vendor contact, **When** clicking contact button, **Then** system prompts for subscription upgrade

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AI cannot parse uploaded documents due to poor quality or unsupported format?
- How does system handle simultaneous assessments from same organization?
- What occurs when vendor marketplace has no matches for identified gaps?
- How does platform manage credit depletion during assessment?
- What happens when Stripe payment fails during subscription renewal?
- How does system handle user attempting to upload malicious files?
