## Conflict Details

### 1. `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`
**Conflict Type**: Both branches added new routes at end of file

**Our Changes (Epic 13)**:
- Added Lead Management routes (4 endpoints):
  - `GET /v1/admin/leads` - List leads with filters
  - `GET /v1/admin/leads/:id` - Get lead details
  - `PATCH /v1/admin/leads/:id` - Update lead status
  - Additional lead routes for export and analytics

**Main Branch Changes**:
- Added extensive Template Management routes (~1,361 lines)
- Added Plan Management routes
- Added Coupon Management routes
- Added Legal Document routes

**Resolution Strategy**: ‚úÖ **SIMPLE - Append both sets**
- Both changes are additive (new routes)
- No overlapping route definitions
- Keep all routes from both branches
- Ensure proper imports for both feature sets

**Estimated Resolution Time**: 10 minutes

---

### 2. `backend/src/server.ts`
**Conflict Type**: Both branches registered new routes

**Our Changes (Epic 13)**:
```typescript
import rfpRoutes from './routes/rfp.routes';

// Later in setupRoutes:
await server.register(rfpRoutes);
```

**Main Branch Changes**:
```typescript
import planRoutes from './routes/plan.routes';
import couponRoutes from './routes/coupon.routes';
import publicPlansRoutes from './routes/public-plans.routes';

// Later in setupRoutes:
await server.register(planRoutes, { prefix: '/admin/plans' });
await server.register(couponRoutes, { prefix: '/admin/coupons' });
await server.register(publicPlansRoutes, { prefix: '/public/plans' });
await server.register(legalDocumentRoutes, { prefix: '/legal-documents' });
```

**Resolution Strategy**: ‚úÖ **SIMPLE - Keep both imports and registrations**
- Add all imports from both branches
- Register all routes in setupRoutes function
- Maintain proper route prefixes

**Estimated Resolution Time**: 5 minutes

---

### 3. `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
**Conflict Type**: Both branches added new API client functions at end of file

**Our Changes (Epic 13)**:
- Added `adminLeadsApi` object with 5 methods:
  - `getLeads()` - Fetch leads with filters
  - `getLead()` - Get single lead
  - `updateLeadStatus()` - Update lead status
  - `getLeadAnalytics()` - Get analytics
  - `exportLeads()` - Export to CSV

**Main Branch Changes**:
- Added extensive `adminTemplateApi` object with template CRUD
- Added TypeScript interfaces for templates, sections, questions
- Added template statistics API

**Resolution Strategy**: ‚úÖ **SIMPLE - Keep both API objects**
- Both changes are additive (new API client objects)
- No overlapping function names
- Keep all interfaces and API objects from both branches
- Maintain proper ordering

**Estimated Resolution Time**: 10 minutes

## Resolution Plan

### Step 1: Merge Preparation
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
git status

# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Create backup branch
git branch epic-13-pre-merge
```

### Step 2: Attempt Merge
```bash
# Start merge from main into feature branch
git merge main
```

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

#### A. Resolve `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`
1. Open file in editor
2. Locate conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Keep BOTH sets of routes:
   - Keep Epic 13 lead management routes
   - Keep main's template/plan/coupon routes
4. Ensure proper imports at top:
   ```typescript
   import { LeadService, LeadType } from '../services/lead.service';
   import { LeadStatus } from '../generated/prisma/index.js';
   // ... other main branch imports
   ```
5. Remove conflict markers
6. Save file

#### B. Resolve `backend/src/server.ts`
1. Open file in editor
2. In imports section, keep BOTH:
   ```typescript
   import rfpRoutes from './routes/rfp.routes';
   import planRoutes from './routes/plan.routes';
   import couponRoutes from './routes/coupon.routes';
   import publicPlansRoutes from './routes/public-plans.routes';
   import legalDocumentRoutes from './routes/legal-document.routes';
   ```
3. In setupRoutes function, keep BOTH registrations:
   ```typescript
   await server.register(rfpRoutes);
   await server.register(planRoutes, { prefix: '/admin/plans' });
   await server.register(couponRoutes, { prefix: '/admin/coupons' });
   await server.register(publicPlansRoutes, { prefix: '/public/plans' });
   await server.register(legalDocumentRoutes, { prefix: '/legal-documents' });
   ```
4. Remove conflict markers
5. Save file

#### C. Resolve `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
1. Open file in editor
2. Keep BOTH API objects:
   - Keep `adminTemplateApi` from main branch
   - Keep `adminLeadsApi` from Epic 13
3. Keep all TypeScript interfaces from both branches
4. Ensure proper ordering (interfaces first, then API objects)
5. Remove conflict markers
6. Save file

### Step 4: Verify Resolution
```bash
# Check that all conflicts are resolved
git status

# Mark files as resolved
git add backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts
git add backend/src/server.ts
git add frontend/src/lib/api.ts

# Verify no remaining conflicts
git status
```

### Step 5: Test Build
```bash
# Backend compilation test
cd backend
npm run build

# Frontend compilation test
cd ../frontend
npm run build
```

### Step 6: Complete Merge
```bash
# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge main into Epic 13 - Resolve conflicts in admin.routes.ts, server.ts, api.ts"

# Push merged branch
git push origin claude/activate-sm-persona-011CUY6si9Yyu8hz4tvBowtf
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- **Prisma Schema**: Auto-merged successfully
  - Epic 13 added: RFP model, LeadStatus enum
  - Main added: LegalDocument model, Plan/Coupon models
  - No overlapping model names or fields

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Route Conflicts**: Straightforward to resolve
  - Both branches added different routes
  - No duplicate route paths
  - Simple append operation

### Potential Issues to Watch üîç

1. **Import Order**: Ensure all new imports are added at top of files
2. **Route Registration Order**: Verify routes are registered in correct order
3. **Database Migration**: After merge, may need to:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:generate
   ```
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Verify all types are correctly imported after merge

## Recommended Merge Strategy

**Option 1: Merge main into feature branch (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# While on epic-13 branch
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
# Test thoroughly
# Push to remote
```

**Pros**:
- Keeps feature branch isolated
- Can test merged code before creating PR
- Easy to rollback if issues found

**Cons**:
- Creates merge commit in feature branch

**Option 2: Rebase feature branch on main**
```bash
# While on epic-13 branch
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts as they appear
# Test thoroughly
# Force push to remote
```

**Pros**:
- Cleaner linear history
- No merge commits

**Cons**:
- More complex conflict resolution (conflicts appear one commit at a time)
- Requires force push
- Higher risk of introducing issues

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use **Option 1 (Merge)** for Epic 13 due to:
- Simpler conflict resolution
- 28 commits would require resolving conflicts 28 times with rebase
- Safer for complex feature branch

## Estimated Timeline

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|---------------|
| Prepare environment | 5 minutes |
| Run merge command | 1 minute |
| Resolve conflicts | 25 minutes |
| Test builds | 10 minutes |
| Manual testing | 15 minutes |
| Commit and push | 5 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **~60 minutes** |

---

## Conclusion

The merge conflicts between Epic 13 and main are **straightforward and low-risk**. All three conflicts are additive in nature:
- Different routes added to the same files
- Different API clients added to the same files
- No overlapping functionality or naming conflicts

With careful attention to preserving all changes from both branches, the merge can be completed successfully in approximately **1 hour** with full testing.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this analysis
2. Create backup branch
3. Execute merge following the step-by-step resolution plan
4. Run comprehensive tests
5. Push merged code
6. Create pull request to main
