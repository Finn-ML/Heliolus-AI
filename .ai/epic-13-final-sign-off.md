## Implementation Order & Estimates

### Phase 1: Foundation (15-17 hours)
1. **Story 13.1** (12-14 hours) - RFP Form & Auto-Population
   - Database schema migration (blocking)
   - RFP service with authorization
   - Strategic roadmap API
   - Document upload
   - Frontend form

2. **Story 13.5** (2-3 hours, parallel with 13.1) - User Tier Access Control
   - Premium tier middleware
   - Frontend tier checks

### Phase 2: Delivery & Tracking (11-14 hours)
3. **Story 13.2** (5-6 hours) - RFP Delivery System
   - Email templates
   - Batch sending with transactions
   - Exponential backoff retry
   - Status updates

4. **Story 13.3** (6-8 hours) - Lead Tracking & Classification
   - Lead service (virtual model)
   - Admin dashboard
   - CSV export

### Phase 3: Management & Contact (8-10 hours)
5. **Story 13.4** (4-5 hours, parallel with 13.6) - User RFP Management Dashboard
   - RFP list view
   - Detail view
   - Activity timeline

6. **Story 13.6** (4-5 hours, parallel with 13.4) - Contact Form System
   - Redis rate limiting
   - Email notification fix
   - Frontend contact form

**Total Estimated Time**: 34-41 hours

---

## Key Architectural Decisions Summary

1. **Data Lifecycle**: Cascade deletes with audit logging (23 existing instances in codebase)
2. **Transaction Boundaries**: 3-phase strategy (DB → Email → DB) for reliability
3. **Email Reliability**: Exponential backoff (2^n * 1000ms + 0-1s jitter) with 3 retries
4. **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based (not in-memory), Premium users exempt
5. **Authorization**: Centralized authorizeRFPAccess() helper prevents IDOR
6. **API Routes**: Plural convention (`/rfps`) matching existing patterns
7. **File Upload**: 10MB standard (matches server.ts:122 limit)
8. **Status Enums**: Keep both RFPStatus (user workflow) and LeadStatus (admin funnel)
9. **Lead Model**: Virtual (no database table), aggregates RFP + VendorContact
10. **Partial Success**: Allow partial email success, report failures to user

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ No Blockers Remaining

All critical blockers have been resolved:
- Schema inconsistencies: FIXED (commit 1cb8c86)
- Missing email notification: DOCUMENTED (Story 13.6)
- Authorization vulnerabilities: DOCUMENTED (Story 13.1)
- Transaction strategy: DOCUMENTED (Story 13.2)

### Low-Risk Items

| Risk | Mitigation | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| Email service rate limits | Exponential backoff + jitter | Low | Low |
| Redis unavailable | Fallback to in-memory Map (temp) | Very Low | Medium |
| Premium tier edge cases | TRIALING status allowed, clear error messages | Low | Low |
| Cascade delete data loss | Audit logging before delete, user confirmation | Very Low | Medium |

---

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests Required
- **Unit Tests**: All services (rfp, strategic-roadmap, lead, email)
- **Contract Tests**: All API routes (7 new routes)
- **Integration Tests**: Transaction boundaries, cascade deletes
- **Email Tests**: Retry logic, partial success, template rendering
- **Rate Limit Tests**: Redis persistence, Premium exemption

### Frontend Tests Required
- **Component Tests**: RFP form, document upload, vendor select
- **Integration Tests**: Form submission, error handling, API integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete RFP creation and send flow

**Estimated Testing Time**: 8-12 hours (included in story estimates)
