# Trade Compliance v3.0 Template - Deduplication Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Questions Reduced:** 110 → 105 (5 duplicates removed)

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive overlap analysis identified 18 potential duplications across the 110-question template (original specification incorrectly stated 120). Of these, 6 issues were identified as **critical duplicates**, with 5 questions removed and 1 question refined. The template now has 105 questions while maintaining clarity and removing redundancy.

The remaining 8 moderate and 4 minor overlaps were determined to be **intentional and beneficial**, testing the same controls from different regulatory perspectives or for different organization types (banks vs. corporates).

## Critical Duplicates Fixed (6 Total)

### 1. **Audit Questions - REMOVED S1.Q10** ✅
**Duplicate:** S1.Q10 and S9.Q2 both asked about independent/annual audits
**Action Taken:** Removed S1.Q10 (Governance), kept S9.Q2 (Monitoring & Audit)
**Rationale:** S9.Q2 is more specific with annual frequency requirement and belongs naturally in the audit section

**Before:**
- S1.Q10: "Are independent audits or external reviews performed?"
- S9.Q2: "Are internal or external audits performed annually?"

**After:**
- S9.Q2 only (unchanged)

**Section 1 Question Count:** 10 → 9

---

### 2. **Classification Questions - MERGED S5.Q2 into S3.Q3** ✅
**Duplicate:** S3.Q3 and S5.Q2 both asked about HS/ECCN classification
**Action Taken:** Enhanced S3.Q3 to include periodic reviews, removed S5.Q2
**Rationale:** Classification belongs in Export Control section; periodic review added as additional option

**Before:**
- S3.Q3: "Are goods classified correctly under HS/ECCN codes?"
- S5.Q2: "Are HS codes and ECCNs reviewed periodically?"

**After:**
- S3.Q3: "Are goods classified correctly under HS/ECCN codes **with periodic reviews**?"
  - New option added: "Yes - initial classification but no periodic reviews" (scores 2/5)
  - Enhanced AI prompt to include review frequency

**Section 5 Question Count:** 10 → 9

---

### 3. **Training Questions - REMOVED S3.Q10** ✅
**Duplicate:** S3.Q10 and S8.Q3 both asked about export control training
**Action Taken:** Removed S3.Q10 (Sanctions & Export Control), kept S8.Q3 (Training & Culture)
**Rationale:** S8.Q3 is more comprehensive with cross-functional coverage

**Before:**
- S3.Q10: "Are employees trained on export control obligations?"
- S8.Q3: "Are procurement, logistics, and finance staff trained on export controls?"

**After:**
- S8.Q3 only (unchanged) - covers all relevant functions comprehensively

**Section 3 Question Count:** 10 → 9

---

### 4. **Supplier Screening - REMOVED S5.Q5** ✅
**Duplicate:** S3.Q1, S5.Q5, and S6.Q1 all addressed screening of business partners
**Action Taken:** Removed S5.Q5, kept S3.Q1 as primary screening question, rephrased S6.Q1
**Rationale:** S3.Q1 comprehensively covers sanctions/export control screening of all counterparties

**Before:**
- S3.Q1: "Are counterparties screened against restricted and denied party lists?" (kept)
- S5.Q5: "Are suppliers screened for sanctions or export control exposure?" (REMOVED)
- S6.Q1: "Are supplier and distributor screening processes documented?" (REPHRASED)

**After:**
- S3.Q1 only for screening existence
- S6.Q1 rephrased to: "Are supplier due diligence **records comprehensive and accessible for audit**?"
  - Now focuses on documentation quality, not screening existence
  - Tests audit trail completeness

**Section 5 Question Count:** 9 → 8

---

### 5. **End-Use Controls - REMOVED S6.Q2** ✅
**Duplicate:** S3.Q4 and S6.Q2 both asked about end-use declarations
**Action Taken:** Removed S6.Q2, kept S3.Q4
**Rationale:** S3.Q4 is more comprehensive ("collected and validated")

**Before:**
- S3.Q4: "Are end-use and end-user declarations collected and validated?"
- S6.Q2: "Are end-use declarations verified and retained?"

**After:**
- S3.Q4 only (unchanged)

**Section 6 Question Count:** 10 → 9

---

### 6. **Document Retention - REFINED S5.Q9** ✅
**Overlap:** S5.Q9 and S7.Q3 both addressed retention compliance
**Action Taken:** Made S5.Q9 specific to customs documents, kept S7.Q3 for general data retention
**Rationale:** Differentiate customs-specific vs. general trade data retention

**Before:**
- S5.Q9: "Are document retention periods aligned with regulatory requirements?" (generic)
- S7.Q3: "Are data retention policies compliant with regulations?" (generic)

**After:**
- S5.Q9: "Are customs documents **(invoices, bills of lading, certificates of origin) retained per requirements**?"
  - Now explicitly lists customs document types
  - Focuses on customs-specific requirements
- S7.Q3: Unchanged - covers broader trade data and electronic records

**No Question Count Change** - Both questions retained but differentiated

## Intentional Overlaps Retained (Justified)

The following overlaps were analyzed and **intentionally kept** as they serve different purposes:

### Moderate Overlaps (8) - Kept with Clarification

1. **Escalation Procedures** (S1.Q6, S3.Q9, S6.Q9)
   - Different contexts: general governance, sanctions-specific, end-use-specific
   - Each tests escalation in different compliance scenarios

   - S3.Q5: Export control red flag monitoring
   - S6.Q3: Supply chain visibility and logistics tracking
   - Different control objectives

4. **Trade Finance Documents** (S4.Q2, S5.Q3)
   - S4.Q2: TBML red flags (banks)
   - S5.Q3: Document consistency (corporates)
   - Different audiences and purposes

5. **Freight Forwarder Controls** (S1.Q5, S5.Q4, S5.Q7)
   - S1.Q5: Contractual governance

   - S5.Q8: Documentation audits (corporates)
   - Industry-specific

7. **Training Programs** (S8.Q1, S8.Q2)
   - S8.Q1: Mandatory nature
   - S8.Q2: Refresher frequency
   - Complementary aspects

8. **Risk Reporting** (S2.Q7, S9.Q6)
   - S2.Q7: Risk assessment results
   - S9.Q6: Operational effectiveness metrics
   - Different content and audiences

### Minor Overlaps (4) - Distinct Enough to Keep

1. **System Integration** (S7.Q2, S4.Q4) - Different systems for different org types
2. **Compliance in Tech Decisions** (S7.Q7, S10.Q15) - General vs. AI-specific
