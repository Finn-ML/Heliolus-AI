## 🎭 Known Edge Cases

### Template Selection (Step 3)
- No templates available → Empty state with support contact
- Single template → Auto-select but show UI for clarity
- User returns to step → Pre-select previous choice

### Guided Questionnaire (Step 5)
- Large template (100+ questions) → Pagination/virtual scrolling
- Network failure during save → Retry with exponential backoff
- User closes browser → Auto-save prevents data loss
- Pre-filled answer conflicts with user input → User input takes priority

### Results Overview (Step 7)
- All TIER_0 answers → Show LOW confidence, suggest uploading docs
- Perfect score (100) → Special congratulations message
- Very low score (<20) → Emphasize support resources
- Backend calculation timeout → Loading state with retry option
