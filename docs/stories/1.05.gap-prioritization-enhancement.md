# Story 1.05: Gap Prioritization Enhancement - Severity, Priority, Effort, Cost

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to enhance gap identification to automatically assign severity, priority, effort, and cost estimates,
**so that** users receive actionable prioritization guidance for remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Extend existing gap identification logic in `assessment.service.ts` to assign:
   - **Severity:** Critical (score <1.5), High (1.5-2.5), Medium (2.5-3.5), Low (3.5+)
   - **Priority:** 1-10 scale based on: severity + question.isFoundational + section.weight
   - **Effort:** SMALL (isolated change), MEDIUM (moderate integration), LARGE (extensive work)
   - **Cost:** Budget range based on effort and gap category
2. Priority calculation formula:
   ```
   priority = (5 - score) * 2                    // Base: 0-10 from score
   priority += question.isFoundational ? 2 : 0   // Boost foundational
   priority += section.weight * 5                // Boost high-weight sections
   priority = Math.min(10, Math.round(priority)) // Cap at 10
   ```
3. Effort estimation logic:
   - SMALL: Section weight <0.15 or non-foundational question
   - MEDIUM: Section weight 0.15-0.25 or foundational question
   - LARGE: Section weight >0.25 and foundational and score <2.0
4. Cost estimation logic:
   - UNDER_10K: Small effort
   - RANGE_10K_50K: Small effort + foundational, or Medium effort
   - RANGE_50K_100K: Medium effort + foundational, or Large effort
   - RANGE_100K_250K: Large effort + Critical severity
   - OVER_250K: Large effort + Critical severity + high section weight (>0.20)
5. Gap records updated with: severity, priority, effort, costRange
6. Method `prioritizeGaps(assessmentId: string): Promise<Gap[]>` returns sorted gaps (priority desc)
7. Unit tests verify priority calculations for all severity/foundational/weight combinations
8. Integration test: Complete assessment, verify gaps have all new fields populated correctly

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts` - MODIFY: Enhance existing gap identification
- `backend/src/types/gap-prioritization.types.ts` - NEW: Type definitions for priority/effort/cost
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Gap model (severity, priority, effort, costRange fields from Story 1.1)
- `backend/src/services/base.service.ts` - Base service class

### Gap Identification Integration

**Existing Gap Identification Logic:**
The current `assessment.service.ts` identifies gaps using a threshold-based approach:
- Questions with finalScore < 3.0 are considered gaps
- Gap title, description, category extracted from question metadata
- Existing severity field uses simple score-based classification

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Preserve existing gap identification threshold (finalScore < 3.0)
- Enhance with new prioritization fields (priority, effort, costRange)
- Add new method `prioritizeGaps()` for sorting and retrieval
- Ensure backward compatibility (existing Gap dashboard continues to work)

### Priority Calculation Formula

```typescript
function calculateGapPriority(
  score: number,
  isFoundational: boolean,
  sectionWeight: number
): number {
  // Base priority from score (lower score = higher priority)
  let priority = (5 - score) * 2  // Range: 0-10

  // Boost for foundational questions
  if (isFoundational) {
    priority += 2
  }

  // Boost based on section regulatory importance
  priority += sectionWeight * 5

  // Cap at maximum priority of 10
  return Math.min(10, Math.round(priority))
}
```

**Example Calculations:**
- Score 1.5, foundational, weight 0.20: (5-1.5)×2 + 2 + 0.20×5 = 7 + 2 + 1 = 10
- Score 2.8, non-foundational, weight 0.10: (5-2.8)×2 + 0 + 0.10×5 = 4.4 + 0.5 = 5
- Score 2.0, foundational, weight 0.30: (5-2.0)×2 + 2 + 0.30×5 = 6 + 2 + 1.5 = 10 (capped)

### Effort Estimation Logic

```typescript
function estimateEffort(
  sectionWeight: number,
  isFoundational: boolean,
  score: number
): EffortRange {
  // Large effort: major section + foundational + severe gap
  if (sectionWeight > 0.25 && isFoundational && score < 2.0) {
    return 'LARGE'
  }

  // Medium effort: moderate section or foundational question
  if (sectionWeight >= 0.15 && sectionWeight <= 0.25) {
    return 'MEDIUM'
  }
  if (isFoundational) {
    return 'MEDIUM'
  }

  // Small effort: everything else
  return 'SMALL'
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Section weight represents regulatory importance and scope
- Foundational questions indicate core compliance requirements
- Low scores indicate more extensive remediation needed

### Cost Estimation Logic

```typescript
function estimateCost(
  effort: EffortRange,
  severity: Severity,
  sectionWeight: number
): CostRange {
  if (effort === 'LARGE' && severity === 'CRITICAL' && sectionWeight > 0.20) {
    return 'OVER_250K'
  }
  if (effort === 'LARGE' && severity === 'CRITICAL') {
    return 'RANGE_100K_250K'
  }
  if (effort === 'LARGE' || (effort === 'MEDIUM' && isFoundational)) {
    return 'RANGE_50K_100K'
  }
  if (effort === 'MEDIUM') {
    return 'RANGE_10K_50K'
  }
  if (effort === 'SMALL' && isFoundational) {
    return 'RANGE_10K_50K'
  }
  return 'UNDER_10K'
}
```

**Cost Ranges (Guidance):**
- UNDER_10K: Quick fixes, configuration changes, training
- RANGE_10K_50K: Process improvements, limited software integration
- RANGE_50K_100K: Significant process redesign, new tooling
- RANGE_100K_250K: Major system implementation, consulting engagement
- OVER_250K: Enterprise-wide transformation, multi-year programs

### Severity Classification

| Score Range | Severity | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| <1.5        | CRITICAL | Severe non-compliance requiring immediate action |
| 1.5-2.5     | HIGH     | Significant gaps needing urgent remediation |
| 2.5-3.5     | MEDIUM   | Moderate gaps requiring planned improvement |
| 3.5+        | LOW      | Minor gaps, continuous improvement |

### Integration with Existing Services

**Caller:** `assessment.service.ts` (on assessment completion)
**Called by:**
- `GET /api/assessments/:id/gaps` endpoint (existing)
- `strategy-matrix.service.ts` (Story 1.9 - uses priority for timeline buckets)
- Frontend Gap Dashboard component

**Database Fields (from Story 1.1):**
- Gap.severity (existing, enhanced)
- Gap.priority (new, integer 1-10)
- Gap.effort (new, enum: SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
- Gap.costRange (new, enum: UNDER_10K/RANGE_10K_50K/etc.)

### Testing

**Unit Testing:**
Location: `backend/src/services/assessment.service.spec.ts` (add tests to existing file)

Framework: Vitest 3

Test cases:
1. Severity calculation: score 1.2 → CRITICAL
2. Severity calculation: score 2.0 → HIGH
3. Severity calculation: score 3.0 → MEDIUM
4. Priority calculation: score 1.5, foundational, weight 0.20 → priority 10
5. Priority calculation: score 2.8, non-foundational, weight 0.10 → priority 5
6. Effort estimation: weight 0.10, non-foundational → SMALL
7. Effort estimation: weight 0.20, foundational → MEDIUM
8. Effort estimation: weight 0.30, foundational, score 1.5 → LARGE
9. Cost estimation: SMALL effort → UNDER_10K
10. Cost estimation: LARGE effort + CRITICAL + weight 0.25 → OVER_250K
11. prioritizeGaps method: 5 gaps sorted by priority descending
12. Edge case: no gaps found (all scores >3.0)

**Integration Testing:**
Location: `backend/tests/integration/gap-prioritization.spec.ts`

Test cases:
1. Complete assessment with varied scores/weights → verify all gaps have prioritization
2. Query gaps via API → verify new fields returned without breaking frontend
3. Backward compatibility → existing gap dashboard works with new fields

**Coverage Target:** ≥80% for new prioritization logic
