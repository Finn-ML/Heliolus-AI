# Performance Baseline - AI Document Processing

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**System:** Heliolus Platform Assessment Execution
**Test:** Current sequential document processing implementation

## Executive Summary

The current system processes documents **sequentially** for each question, resulting in significant performance bottlenecks for assessments with multiple documents. The benchmark establishes a clear baseline and identifies opportunities for **5.8x performance improvement** and **84% cost reduction**.

## Benchmark Results

### Performance Summary

| Test Scenario | Documents | Questions | Time | API Calls | Throughput |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|------------|
| Small Assessment | 3 | 10 | 4.01s | ~30 | 7.47 ops/s |
| Medium Assessment | 7 | 25 | 22.22s | ~175 | 7.88 ops/s |
| Large Assessment | 7 | 50 | 45.46s | ~350 | 7.7 ops/s |
| **Current User Scenario** | **7** | **50** | **46.05s** | **~350** | **7.6 ops/s** |

### Current User Impact

For the reported scenario (7 documents, 50 questions):
- **Total Processing Time:** 46.1 seconds (~0.8 minutes)
- **Total API Calls:** 350 OpenAI calls
- **Average per Question:** 921ms
- **Average per Document:** 6.6 seconds
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$3.50 per assessment (at $0.01 per API call)

### Detailed Timing Statistics

**Document Processing per API call:**
- **Average:** 599ms
- **Median:** 594ms
- **Min:** 401ms
- **Max:** 805ms
- **P95:** 785ms
- **Total Samples:** 905 API calls simulated

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Root Cause

**Location:** `backend/src/services/ai-analysis.service.ts:409-441`

```typescript
// CURRENT BOTTLENECK (Sequential Processing)
for (const content of searchableContent) {  // 7 documents
  try {
    const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      // Each document analyzed separately for EVERY question
    });
    // Process response...
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

**Flow:**
```
For each question (50 questions):
  For each document (7 documents):  ‚Üê BOTTLENECK
    OpenAI API call (~600ms each)
    Parse and extract evidence

Total: 50 √ó 7 = 350 sequential API calls
Time: 350 √ó 0.6s = 210s (theoretical minimum)
Actual: 46s (due to batching of 5 questions at a time)
```

### Why This Is Slow

1. **Redundant Processing:** Same document analyzed 50 times (once per question)
2. **Sequential Execution:** Documents processed one-by-one instead of parallel
3. **No Caching:** No reuse of document analysis between questions
4. **API Latency:** Each call has 400-800ms latency
5. **Batch Limitations:** Current batch size of 5 questions only provides 5x parallelism

## Optimization Opportunities

### Strategy 1: Document Preprocessing
**Concept:** Extract document information ONCE, reuse for all questions

| Metric | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| API Calls | 350 | 57 | 84% reduction |
| Estimated Time | 46.1s | 11s | 4.2x faster |
| Cost | $3.50 | $0.57 | 84% savings |

**Implementation:**
- Preprocess all 7 documents in parallel (7 API calls, ~4s total)
- Analyze each question against preprocessed data (50 API calls, ~7s total)
- Total: 57 API calls, ~11 seconds

### Strategy 2: Parallel Document Processing
**Concept:** Process all documents simultaneously per question

| Metric | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| API Calls | 350 | 350 | No change |
| Estimated Time | 46.1s | 25s | 1.8x faster |
| Cost | $3.50 | $3.50 | No change |

**Implementation:**
- Replace sequential loop with Promise.all()
- Process 7 documents in parallel per question
- Limited by API rate limits and concurrent call restrictions

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Recommended)
**Concept:** Preprocessing + relevance filtering + parallel processing

| Metric | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| API Calls | 350 | 57 | 84% reduction |
| Estimated Time | 46.1s | 8s | **5.8x faster** |
| Cost | $3.50 | $0.57 | **84% savings** |

**Implementation:**
1. Preprocess all documents in parallel (7 calls, ~1s with full parallelism)
2. For each question:
   - Rank documents by relevance (in-memory, <10ms)
   - Select top 3 most relevant documents
   - Single API call with combined context (~150ms)
3. Total: 7 preprocessing + 50 analysis = 57 API calls, ~8 seconds

**Why Hybrid Is Best:**
- ‚úÖ Massive cost reduction (84%)
- ‚úÖ Significant speed improvement (5.8x)
- ‚úÖ Better accuracy (focused on relevant documents)
- ‚úÖ Scalable (works with 50+ documents)
- ‚úÖ Maintains quality (still uses all document data via preprocessing)

## Comparison with Target Performance

| Target (Story 1.26) | Baseline | Status |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| <30s execution time | 46.1s | ‚ùå Exceeds by 16s |
| <10s preprocessing | N/A (no preprocessing) | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| <0.4s per question | 0.92s | ‚ùå Exceeds by 0.52s |
| 84% API reduction | 0% | ‚ùå No optimization |

**Verdict:** Current implementation **fails all performance targets**. Optimization is required.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Hybrid Strategy (Story 1.26)
- **Impact:** 5.8x speedup, 84% cost reduction
- **Effort:** 2-3 days development
- **Risk:** Low (backward compatible)
- **Dependencies:** OpenAI embeddings API

### Priority 2: Add Performance Monitoring
- **Impact:** Visibility into production performance
- **Effort:** 1 day
- **Metrics:** API call count, processing time, cache hit rates

### Priority 3: Rate Limit Handling
- **Impact:** Reliability under load
- **Effort:** 1 day
- **Implementation:** Exponential backoff, retry logic

## Technical Implementation

Full implementation plan documented in:
- **Story:** `docs/stories/1.26.ai-document-processing-optimization.md`
- **Benchmark Script:** `backend/scripts/assessment-performance-benchmark.ts`
- **Benchmark Results:** `backend/benchmark-results.json`

## Conclusion

The benchmark confirms the hypothesis that sequential document processing is the primary bottleneck. The **hybrid optimization strategy** offers the best balance of performance improvement, cost reduction, and implementation complexity. Implementation should proceed immediately to address the 46-second execution time for the current user scenario.

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Baseline established (this document)
2. üîÑ Implement Story 1.26 (in progress)
3. ‚è≥ Re-run benchmark after optimization
4. ‚è≥ Validate 5.8x speedup achieved
5. ‚è≥ Deploy to production with monitoring
