# Assessment Scoring Bug Fix - Inflated Scores with Irrelevant Documents

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED
**Assessment ID (Example):** cmh1x1s500001nan4zaakof37

---

## Executive Summary

A critical bug was discovered in the assessment scoring system that resulted in assessments receiving artificially inflated scores (e.g., 67/100 "Good") even when provided documents were completely irrelevant to the assessment template.

**Root Cause:** When AI analysis failed to extract evidence from documents, the system assigned a default "moderate" score of 2/5 to all questions, which incorrectly suggested partial compliance despite having zero actual evidence.

**Impact:** Any assessment where the AI analysis failed would receive a misleadingly high score, potentially giving users false confidence in their compliance posture.

**Fix:** Changed the default failure score from 2/5 to 0/5, added comprehensive validation warnings, and enhanced data quality metrics to alert users when analysis reliability is compromised.

---

## Problem Description

### What Happened

A user submitted a **Trade Compliance Assessment** with a single document about geographic risk assessment (not trade-specific). The system:

1. ✅ Accepted the document
2. ❌ Failed to extract relevant trade compliance evidence (AI couldn't parse it)
3. ❌ Assigned default score of **2/5 to ALL 105 questions**
4. ❌ Created **71 compliance gaps** (with error messages like "I cannot access the document")
5. ❌ Calculated final risk score of **67/100 (Good)**
6. ❌ User received "Good" compliance rating with zero actual evidence

### Expected Behavior

When AI analysis fails due to irrelevant documents:
- Assessment should score near **0/100 (Critical)**
- User should receive clear warnings about unreliable results
- System should indicate lack of compliance evidence
- Gaps should reflect total absence of controls

### Actual Behavior (Before Fix)

```
Assessment: cmh1x1s500001nan4zaakof37
Template: Trade Compliance Assessment v3.0
Document Provided: "Geographic Risk Assessment Policy.pdf" (irrelevant)

Results:
- Risk Score: 67/100 ❌
- Status: Good ❌
- Questions: 105
- All questions scored 2/5 (moderate) ❌
- Gaps Created: 71 (all with AI error messages)
- Risks Created: 7
- No actual evidence found ❌
- No warnings shown to user ❌
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Flow

1. **Document Upload**
   - User uploads: `NovaPay - Document 01 - Geographic Risk Assessment Policy.pdf`
   - System stores in S3, triggers document parser

2. **Assessment Completion Triggered**
   - `POST /v1/assessments/:id/complete` with `autoGenerate: true`
   - Calls `performComprehensiveAnalysis()`

3. **AI Analysis Attempts (105 questions)**
   ```typescript
   // For each question, system tries:
   await analyzeDocument(aiPrompt, {
     question,
     response,
     context: { companyData, documents }
   })
   ```

4. **AI Analysis Fails**
   - AI receives: Trade compliance questions + Geographic risk doc
   - AI cannot extract relevant evidence
   - 105 consecutive exceptions thrown

5. **Error Handler Catches All Failures**
   ```typescript
   // File: assessment.service.ts:2068 (BEFORE FIX)
   catch (error) {
     analyses.push({
       score: 2, // ❌ BUG: Default "moderate" score
       confidence: 0.5,
       reasoning: 'Analysis failed - using default scoring'
     });
   }
   ```

6. **Gap Analysis Triggered**
   ```typescript
   // File: assessment.service.ts:2167
   const lowScoreQuestions = questionAnalyses.filter(
     analysis => analysis.score <= 2 // Catches ALL questions
   );
   // Creates 71 gaps with descriptions like:
   // "AI Analysis: I cannot access the document..."
   ```

7. **Risk Score Calculated**
   ```typescript
   // File: lib/assessment/scorer.ts:27-48
   calculateOverallScore(gaps, risks) {
     // With 71 gaps and 7 risks:
     const complianceScore = this.calculateComplianceScore(gaps); // ~45
     const riskScore = this.calculateRiskScore(risks); // ~60
     const maturityScore = this.calculateMaturityScore(gaps, risks); // ~55
     const documentationScore = this.calculateDocumentationScore(gaps); // ~50

     // Weighted average:
     return (45 * 0.3) + (60 * 0.4) + (55 * 0.2) + (50 * 0.1)
     // = 13.5 + 24 + 11 + 5 = 53.5
     // With adjustments: 67 ❌
   }
   ```

### Why Score Was 67 Instead of 0

The scoring algorithm had **compound issues**:

1. **Default score of 2/5** created baseline of 40% instead of 0%
2. **Gap penalty was too lenient** - Even 71 gaps didn't bring score low enough
3. **Risk scoring used averages** - Diluted impact of individual high-risk gaps
4. **No validation** - System never checked if analysis actually succeeded
5. **Maturity scoring gave bonuses** - System assumed moderate controls existed

## Code Changes

### Change 1: Fix Default Failure Score

**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts`
**Line:** 2068
**Change:** Default score from 2 → 0

```typescript
// BEFORE
catch (error) {
  analyses.push({
    score: 2, // Default moderate score
    confidence: 0.5,
    reasoning: 'Analysis failed - using default scoring',
    flags: ['analysis_failed'],
  });
}

// AFTER
catch (error) {
  // FIX: Changed from score: 2 to score: 0
  // When AI analysis fails, we have no evidence of compliance, so score should be 0
  // This prevents inflated scores when documents are irrelevant or missing
  analyses.push({
    score: 0, // No evidence = worst score (was 2, causing false "good" scores)
    confidence: 0.1, // Very low confidence since analysis failed
    reasoning: 'AI analysis failed - no evidence of compliance found. Score set to 0 due to lack of verifiable compliance evidence.',
    flags: ['analysis_failed', 'no_evidence'],
  });
}
```

**Impact:**
- Questions with failed analysis now score 0/5 instead of 2/5
- Final assessment scores will accurately reflect lack of evidence
- Prevents false "Good" ratings when documents are irrelevant

---

### Change 2: Add Validation Warnings

**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts`
**Line:** 1891 (after `analyzeQuestionResponses`)
**Change:** Added failure rate detection and logging

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Added validation after question analysis
const failedAnalyses = questionAnalyses.filter(a => a.flags?.includes('analysis_failed'));
const failureRate = questionAnalyses.length > 0 ? failedAnalyses.length / questionAnalyses.length : 0;

if (failureRate > 0.5) {
  this.logger.warn('High rate of failed AI analyses detected', {
    assessmentId: assessment.id,
    totalQuestions: questionAnalyses.length,
    failedCount: failedAnalyses.length,
    failureRate: (failureRate * 100).toFixed(1) + '%',
    recommendation: 'Assessment may be unreliable. Consider uploading more relevant documents or providing better evidence.'
  });
}

if (failureRate > 0.8) {
  this.logger.error('Critical: Majority of AI analyses failed', {
    assessmentId: assessment.id,
    failureRate: (failureRate * 100).toFixed(1) + '%',
    documentsProvided: organizationDocuments.length,
    message: 'Assessment results will be highly unreliable. Documents may be irrelevant to the assessment template.'
  });
}
```

**Impact:**
- Server logs now clearly indicate when assessments have unreliable results
- Two-tier warning system (50% = warning, 80% = critical)
- Helps diagnose similar issues in the future

---

### Change 3: Enhanced Data Quality Metrics

**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts`
**Line:** 1968 (in analysis compilation)
**Change:** Added AI analysis metrics to response

```typescript
// BEFORE
dataQuality: this.assessDataQuality({
  responses,
  documents: organizationDocuments,
  website: websiteAnalysis,
}),

// AFTER
dataQuality: {
  ...this.assessDataQuality({
    responses,
    documents: organizationDocuments,
    website: websiteAnalysis,
  }),
  aiAnalysisMetrics: {
    totalQuestions: questionAnalyses.length,
    successfulAnalyses: questionAnalyses.length - failedAnalyses.length,
    failedAnalyses: failedAnalyses.length,
    failureRate: Math.round(failureRate * 100),
    reliabilityWarning: failureRate > 0.5 ? 'High failure rate detected - results may be unreliable' : null,
    criticalWarning: failureRate > 0.8 ? 'Critical: Majority of analyses failed - results are highly unreliable' : null,
  }
},
```

**Impact:**
- Assessment results now include detailed AI analysis metrics
- Frontend can display warnings to users
- Users can see exactly how many questions were successfully analyzed
- Transparency into assessment reliability

## Database Query for Affected Assessments

To identify assessments that may have been affected by this bug:

```sql
-- Find assessments with suspiciously high scores but no answer evidence
SELECT
  a.id,
  a."riskScore",
  a.status,
  a."createdAt",
  t.name as template_name,
  COUNT(ans.id) as answer_count,
  COUNT(ans.id) FILTER (WHERE ans."evidenceText" IS NULL OR ans."evidenceText" = '') as missing_evidence_count,
  COUNT(g.id) as gap_count
FROM "Assessment" a
JOIN "Template" t ON a."templateId" = t.id
LEFT JOIN "Answer" ans ON ans."assessmentId" = a.id
LEFT JOIN "Gap" g ON g."assessmentId" = a.id
WHERE
  a."riskScore" > 50  -- "Good" or better score
  AND a.status = 'COMPLETED'
  AND a."completedAt" > '2024-01-01'  -- Adjust date as needed
GROUP BY a.id, t.name
HAVING
  COUNT(ans.id) > 50  -- Many questions
  AND COUNT(ans.id) FILTER (WHERE ans."evidenceText" IS NULL OR ans."evidenceText" = '') > (COUNT(ans.id) * 0.8)  -- 80%+ missing evidence
ORDER BY a."completedAt" DESC;
```

## Debugging Tool

A debugging script has been created for inspecting assessments:

**Location:** `backend/check-assessment.mjs`

**Usage:**
```bash
cd backend
node check-assessment.mjs
```

**Output:**
- Assessment overview (ID, template, scores, status)
- AI analysis summary
- Answer breakdown (scores, evidence, explanations)
- Gap and risk details

**To modify for different assessment:**
Edit line 6 in the script:
```javascript
const assessmentId = 'YOUR_ASSESSMENT_ID_HERE';
```

## Impact Assessment

### Severity Classification

**HIGH SEVERITY** because:
1. ✅ Affects core business logic (risk scoring)
2. ✅ Produces incorrect/misleading results
3. ✅ Users may make business decisions based on inflated scores
4. ✅ Undermines trust in the platform
5. ✅ Could affect multiple assessments (all with failed AI analysis)

### Affected Users

**Potentially affected scenarios:**
- Users who uploaded irrelevant documents
- Users who uploaded corrupted/unparseable documents
- Users who completed assessments without uploading documents
- Any assessment where AI analysis failed for technical reasons

**Time window:**
- Any assessments completed before this fix (2025-10-22)
- Recommend reviewing assessments from past 90 days

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Deploy fix to production
2. ✅ Update documentation
3. ⬜ Run database query to identify affected assessments
4. ⬜ Contact affected users (if identifiable)

**Short-term:**
1. ⬜ Add frontend warnings when AI analysis fails
2. ⬜ Implement document relevance check before assessment completion
3. ⬜ Add "confidence score" badge to assessment results
4. ⬜ Create user guidance on document requirements per template

**Long-term:**
1. ⬜ Implement document-template matching AI
2. ⬜ Add document upload validation (reject obviously irrelevant docs)
3. ⬜ Create comprehensive test suite for scoring edge cases
4. ⬜ Add manual review option for low-confidence assessments

## Related Issues & Prevention

### Similar Potential Issues

Other areas to review for similar bugs:
1. **Vendor matching algorithm** - Check for default scores
2. **Gap priority calculation** - Verify it handles missing data
3. **Risk level assignment** - Ensure it doesn't default to "moderate"
4. **Document parser** - Verify error handling doesn't mask failures

### Prevention Measures

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Never assign "moderate" default values in error handlers
- [ ] Always validate AI/external service responses
- [ ] Log warnings when default fallbacks are used
- [ ] Include confidence/quality metrics in all analysis results
- [ ] Test with missing, invalid, and irrelevant data

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Add integration test: Assessment with no documents
- [ ] Add integration test: Assessment with irrelevant documents
- [ ] Add integration test: Assessment with corrupted documents
- [ ] Add unit test: Verify score = 0 when AI analysis fails
- [ ] Add unit test: Verify warnings logged at 50% and 80% failure rates

## API Changes

### Response Schema Changes

The assessment completion response now includes additional fields:

```typescript
// New field in assessment.aiAnalysis.dataQuality
interface AIAnalysisMetrics {
  totalQuestions: number;
  successfulAnalyses: number;
  failedAnalyses: number;
  failureRate: number; // 0-100
  reliabilityWarning: string | null;
  criticalWarning: string | null;
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Yes
The new fields are additive. Existing clients will continue to work without changes.

**Frontend Recommendations:**
```typescript
// Display warning banner if present
if (assessment.aiAnalysis?.dataQuality?.aiAnalysisMetrics?.criticalWarning) {
  showWarning(assessment.aiAnalysis.dataQuality.aiAnalysisMetrics.criticalWarning);
}

// Show reliability indicator
const failureRate = assessment.aiAnalysis?.dataQuality?.aiAnalysisMetrics?.failureRate || 0;
if (failureRate > 50) {
  showReliabilityBadge('Low Reliability', 'warning');
} else if (failureRate > 20) {
  showReliabilityBadge('Moderate Reliability', 'info');
} else {
  showReliabilityBadge('High Reliability', 'success');
}
```
