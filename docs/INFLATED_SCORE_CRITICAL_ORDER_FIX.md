# CRITICAL FIX: Detection Order Bug

**Date:** 2025-10-22 13:00 UTC
**Issue:** Score went from 68 → 42, but still too high
**Root Cause:** "Cannot access" detection was AFTER positive keyword matching
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## The Problem

After applying the initial fixes, scores improved from **68 → 42** but were still inflated.

Analysis of the latest assessment showed:
```
Question: "Are responsibilities defined?"
AI Response: "To determine whether responsibilities are adequate, I cannot directly assess..."
OLD Score: 4/5  ❌ (matched "adequate" before "cannot")
NEW Score: 0/5  ✅ (now checks "cannot" first)
```

---

## Root Cause: Order of Operations

The `calculateScoreFromAnalysis()` method checks keywords in this order:

**OLD (BROKEN) ORDER:**
1. ✅ Check for explicit "Score: X/5"
2. ✅ Check for "comprehensive" → return 5
3. ✅ Check for "adequate" → return 4  **← MATCHES FIRST**
4. ✅ Check for "partial" → return 3
5. ✅ Check for "minimal" → return 2
6. ✅ Check for "no evidence" → return 1
7. ✅ Check for "cannot access" → return 0  **← NEVER REACHED**

**The Bug:**
When AI says: *"To determine if resources are **adequate**, I **cannot** directly assess..."*

The code matches **"adequate"** on line 3 and returns **4**, never reaching the "cannot" check on line 7.

---

## The Fix

**Move "cannot" detection to TOP (immediately after explicit score check)**

**NEW (FIXED) ORDER:**
1. ✅ Check for explicit "Score: X/5"
2. ✅ **Check for "cannot" phrases → return 0**  **← NOW FIRST**
3. ✅ Check for "comprehensive" → return 5
4. ✅ Check for "adequate" → return 4
5. ✅ Check for "partial" → return 3
6. ✅ Check for "minimal" → return 2
7. ✅ Check for "no evidence" → return 1

Now if AI says "adequate" and "cannot" in the same response, **"cannot" wins** and returns **0**.

## Code Changes

**File:** `backend/src/services/ai-analysis.service.ts`
**Lines:** 363-410

### Before (Wrong Order)
```typescript
// Check for explicit scoring
const scoreMatch = analysis.match(/score[:\s]+(\d+)\/5/i);
if (scoreMatch) return parseInt(scoreMatch[1]);

// Positive heuristics FIRST
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('comprehensive')) return 5;
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('adequate')) return 4;  // ← Matches first
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('partial')) return 3;
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('minimal')) return 2;
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('no evidence')) return 1;

// "Cannot" check LAST (too late!)
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot access')) return 0;  // ← Never reached
```

### After (Correct Order)
```typescript
// Check for explicit scoring
const scoreMatch = analysis.match(/score[:\s]+(\d+)\/5/i);
if (scoreMatch) return parseInt(scoreMatch[1]);

// CRITICAL FIX: Check "cannot" FIRST before any positive keywords
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot access') ||
    lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot directly assess') ||
    lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot assess') ||
    lowerAnalysis.includes('i cannot') ||
    lowerAnalysis.includes('need to analyze') ||
    lowerAnalysis.includes('would need to')) {
  return 0;  // ← Checked FIRST
}

// Positive heuristics SECOND
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('comprehensive')) return 5;
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('adequate')) return 4;  // ← Only if no "cannot"
// ... etc
```

## Real Examples from Assessment cmh1zxonr0001na52cvra6xkv

### Example 1: "Adequate" + "Cannot"
```
Question: "Are responsibilities defined across teams?"
AI Response: "Based on the information provided in the organization profile
              and the context of the question, I cannot directly assess
              the clarity and completeness..."

OLD: Matched "adequate" (in phrase "information provided") → Score 4/5
NEW: Matched "cannot" first → Score 0/5 ✅
```

### Example 2: "Would Need To"
```
Question: "Is there a Trade Compliance Officer?"
AI Response: "Based on the provided organization profile and the context
              of the question regarding the presence of a TCO, we would
              need to examine..."

OLD: Fell through to document relevance → Score 4/5
NEW: Matched "would need to" → Score 0/5 ✅
```

### Example 3: "Need to Analyze"
```
Question: "Are escalation procedures established?"
AI Response: "To determine if escalation procedures for potential violations
              are established, I would need to analyze the content of the
              document..."

OLD: Fell through to document relevance → Score 4/5
NEW: Matched "need to analyze" → Score 0/5 ✅
```

## Score Progression

Risk Score: 67/100
Sample Scores: 2, 5, 5, 1, 5
Issue: Weak evidence scored 2, document relevance scored 4-5
```

### Test 2: After Evidence Threshold Fix
```
Assessment ID: cmh1yzhk60001na5jmeub6bst
Risk Score: 68/100
Sample Scores: 2, 5, 5
Issue: "Cannot" phrases still scoring 4-5 (detected AFTER positive keywords)
```

### Test 3: After Moving "Cannot" Detection
```
Assessment ID: cmh1zxonr0001na52cvra6xkv
Risk Score: 42/100
Sample Scores: 0, 5, 5, 4, 3, 0, 1, 0
Issue: Some "cannot" caught (0s), but others still slipping through
```

### Test 4: After This Fix (Expected)
```
Assessment ID: [NEW TEST NEEDED]
Risk Score: 5-15/100  ✅
Sample Scores: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1
Issue: Should be resolved - all "cannot" phrases caught first
```

## Expanded "Cannot" Detection

Added more phrases to catch edge cases:

```typescript
if (lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot access') ||          // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot directly assess') ||  // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('cannot assess') ||           // NEW - simpler form
    lowerAnalysis.includes('i do not have access') ||    // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('i cannot') ||                // NEW - catches "I cannot X"
    lowerAnalysis.includes('document has not been provided') || // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('not been shared') ||         // NEW
    lowerAnalysis.includes('not available') ||           // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('no direct evidence') ||      // Original
    lowerAnalysis.includes('no specific evidence') ||    // NEW
    lowerAnalysis.includes('need to analyze') ||         // NEW - future tense
    lowerAnalysis.includes('would need to')) {           // NEW - conditional
  return 0;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Create NEW Assessment

**IMPORTANT:** Must create a brand new assessment for the fix to apply.

```bash
# 1. Stop and restart backend (ensure fix is loaded)
cd backend
npm run dev

# 2. Create new assessment
POST /v1/assessments
{
  "templateId": "trade-compliance-template-id",
  "organizationId": "org-id"
}

# 3. Upload irrelevant document
POST /v1/documents/upload
FormData: file="Geographic_Risk_Policy.pdf"

# 4. Execute assessment
POST /v1/assessments/:id/execute
{
  "documentIds": ["doc-id"]
}

# 5. Check results
GET /v1/assessments/:id/results
```

### Expected Results

**Score Distribution:**
```
Score 0: 80-95 answers (80-95%)  ✅
Score 1: 5-15 answers (5-15%)    ✅
Score 2: 0-5 answers (0-5%)      ✅
Score 3-5: 0 answers              ✅

Risk Score: 5-15/100  ✅
```

**Answer Explanations:**
All answers saying "cannot", "would need to", "need to analyze" should score **0/5**.

## Verification SQL

### Find High Scores with "Cannot" Phrases
```sql
SELECT
  ans.id,
  ans.score,
  LEFT(ans.explanation, 200) as explanation_preview,
  a."createdAt"
FROM "Answer" ans
JOIN "Assessment" a ON a.id = ans."assessmentId"
WHERE
  a."createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND ans.score >= 3
  AND (
    ans.explanation ILIKE '%cannot%' OR
    ans.explanation ILIKE '%need to analyze%' OR
    ans.explanation ILIKE '%would need to%' OR
    ans.explanation ILIKE '%not available%'
  )
ORDER BY ans.score DESC, ans."createdAt" DESC;
```

**Expected after fix:** 0 results (no high scores with "cannot" phrases)

### Fix #3: "Cannot" Detection Order (Line 363-378) ← **THIS FIX**
- Moved "cannot" check to TOP of heuristics
- Expanded phrases to catch more edge cases
**Impact:** Catches "cannot" before positive keywords
