## üöÄ Next Steps

**To pick this up in a fresh chat tomorrow:**

1. Review this plan document: `docs/ASSESSMENT-JOURNEY-REDESIGN-PLAN.md`
2. Reference screenshots in `docs/` folder
3. Answer open questions in priority order
4. Choose implementation approach:
   - Option A: Create detailed front-end spec (`*create-front-end-spec`)
   - Option B: Generate AI UI prompts for v0/Lovable (`*generate-ui-prompt`)
