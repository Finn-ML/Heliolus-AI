# Quick Summary - Assessment Scoring Bug Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Issue:** Assessments receiving inflated scores (67/100) despite irrelevant documents
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## The Problem in 30 Seconds

When AI analysis failed to extract evidence from documents, the system gave ALL questions a score of 2/5 (moderate), resulting in a misleading "Good" overall score even with zero actual evidence.

**Example:**
- User submitted Trade Compliance assessment with geographic risk document (irrelevant)
- Got score: **67/100 (Good)** ❌
- Should have been: **0-10/100 (Critical)** ✅

---

## The Fix

### 1. Changed Default Failure Score: 2 → 0
**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts:2071`

```typescript
// When AI analysis fails:
score: 0,  // Was 2 - now accurately reflects "no evidence"
confidence: 0.1,  // Was 0.5 - now shows very low confidence
```

### 2. Added Validation Warnings
**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts:1891-1912`

Server now logs warnings when:
- 50%+ of questions fail AI analysis (WARNING)
- 80%+ of questions fail AI analysis (CRITICAL)

### 3. Enhanced Response Data
**File:** `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts:1974-1981`

API responses now include:
```json
{
  "dataQuality": {
    "aiAnalysisMetrics": {
      "totalQuestions": 105,
      "failedAnalyses": 105,
      "failureRate": 100,
      "criticalWarning": "Critical: Majority of analyses failed..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Changed

1. `backend/src/services/assessment.service.ts` - Main fix (3 sections)
2. `docs/INFLATED_SCORE_BUG_FIX.md` - Comprehensive documentation
3. `backend/check-assessment.mjs` - Debugging tool (already existed)

---

## Testing

**Run the debugging tool:**
```bash
cd backend
node check-assessment.mjs
```

**Test scenario:**
1. Create Trade Compliance assessment
2. Upload irrelevant document (e.g., HR policy)
3. Complete assessment
4. Verify score is near 0, not 60+
5. Check API response for `aiAnalysisMetrics.criticalWarning`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Deploy)
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Test with real assessment
- [ ] Verify logs show warnings

### Post-Deploy
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Query database for affected assessments
- [ ] Add frontend warning display
- [ ] Update user documentation

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add document relevance check before assessment
- [ ] Implement document-template matching AI
- [ ] Block completion if 80%+ analyses fail
- [ ] Add "confidence score" badge to results page

---

## Impact

**Severity:** HIGH
- Affects all assessments with failed AI analysis
- Produces misleading "Good" scores
- User trust impact

**Affected Users:**
- Anyone who uploaded irrelevant documents
- Anyone who completed assessments without documents
- Any technical failures in AI analysis

**Mitigation:**
- Fix prevents future inflated scores
- Add query to identify past affected assessments
- Consider notifying affected users

## Quick Reference

**Full documentation:** `docs/INFLATED_SCORE_BUG_FIX.md`

**Key metric to watch:**
```
aiAnalysis.dataQuality.aiAnalysisMetrics.failureRate
```

**Acceptable ranges:**
- 0-20% = Good (normal)
- 21-50% = Warning (needs attention)
- 51-80% = High concern (unreliable results)
- 81-100% = Critical (results invalid)

**Version:** 1.0
**Compiled Successfully:** ✅ (No new TypeScript errors)
